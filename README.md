GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# Gemini API
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

4. Start the backend:
```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd ../frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
```

4. Start the frontend:
```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

## üí° AI Features Explained

### Natural Language to Segment Rules
This feature uses Gemini API to parse natural language descriptions and convert them into structured segmentation rules. For example, a user can type "customers who spent over ‚Çπ5000 in the last 6 months and haven't shopped recently" and the system will generate the corresponding rule logic.

### AI-Driven Message Suggestions
Based on the campaign objective (e.g., "bring back inactive users"), the system generates personalized message templates that are likely to resonate with the target audience.

### Campaign Performance Insights
Instead of just showing raw stats, this feature provides human-readable insights about campaign performance, including success rates, patterns, and recommendations for improvement.

### Smart Scheduling
Analyzes general email engagement patterns and user behavior to recommend optimal days and times to send campaigns, tailored to different audience segments.

### Lookalike Audience Generator
Creates expanded audience segments based on characteristics of an existing segment, helping marketers reach similar customers who might respond well to the same campaign.

### Auto-tagging
Automatically generates relevant tags for campaigns based on the audience definition, message content, and campaign objective, making organization and reporting easier.

### Image Concept Suggestions
Recommends visual concepts for campaign images based on the message content and tone, including description, color schemes, and rationale for why they would work well.

## üö¢ Deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- The AI features require API keys with appropriate rate limits
- The mock vendor API simulates message delivery but doesn't actually send messages
- The batch processing in Redis consumers is simplified for demonstration purposes
- Local development requires running both MongoDB and Redis

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Add unit and integration tests
- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Add export functionality for campaign results
- Enhance analytics with more detailed visualizations
- Add multi-channel campaign support (email, SMS, push notifications)
- Implement A/B testing framework
- Add user roles and permissions
